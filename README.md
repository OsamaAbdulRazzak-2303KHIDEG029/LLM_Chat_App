LLM Chat App Documentation
**Introduction**
The LLM Chat App is a web-based chatbot application that uses advanced language models and
embeddings to enable users to interact with a chatbot that can answer questions related to PDF
documents. This documentation provides an overview of the application, its features, and how to
use it effectively.
**Features**
‚Ä¢ Upload PDF documents.
‚Ä¢ Extract text from PDF documents.
‚Ä¢ Split text into smaller chunks.
‚Ä¢ Compute embeddings for text chunks.
‚Ä¢ Chat with an OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo-powered chatbot.
‚Ä¢ View chat history.
**Usage**
To use the LLM Chat App, follow these steps:
1. **Running the Application**
You can run the application by executing the following command in your terminal:
streamlit run script_name.py
Replace script_name.py with the name of the Python script that contains the
application code.
2. **Upload a PDF Document**
In the sidebar, you will find an option to "Chat with PDF üí¨." Click the "Upload your PDF
here üìù" button to select and upload a PDF document.
3. **PDF Processing**
The application will extract text from the uploaded PDF document and split it into smaller
chunks for processing.
4. **Embeddings Computation**
The application uses the "sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2" model to compute
embeddings for the text chunks. If the embeddings have not been computed previously, the
app will calculate them and store them for future use.
5. **Chat with the Assistant**
‚Ä¢ Enter your questions in the chat input box and press "Enter."LLM Chat App Documentation
‚Ä¢ The chatbot, powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model, will generate responses
based on the uploaded PDF document and your queries.
‚Ä¢ The chat history will be displayed, showing both your questions and the chatbot's
responses.
**OpenAI API Key**
To use the GPT-3.5 Turbo chatbot, you must provide your own OpenAI API key. Ensure that you
have set your API key in a .env file in the project directory. The application will read this API key
from the environment variables.
**Challenges at Production Site**
Deploying this application in a production environment may present some challenges:
‚Ä¢ Scalability: Handling concurrent users and optimizing the application's performance may
require resource scaling and load balancing.
‚Ä¢ API Rate Limits: Carefully manage API rate limits to avoid exceeding OpenAI's usage
limits.
‚Ä¢ Data Security: Implement data security measures to protect sensitive information from
users' PDF uploads.
‚Ä¢ Error Handling: Enhance error handling to provide better user experiences and capture and
log errors effectively.
**Areas of Improvement**
The LLM Chat App has areas for improvement, including:
‚Ä¢ User Interface: Enhance the user interface design for a more user-friendly experience.
‚Ä¢ Error Messages: Improve error messages and feedback to users when issues arise.
‚Ä¢ Performance Optimization: Optimize the application's performance, especially for large
PDF documents.
**About Embeddings**
The embeddings used in this application are based on the "sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-
v2" model, which is a pre-trained transformer model for generating sentence embeddings. This
model is freely available and open source, making it accessible for embedding text data.LLM Chat App Documentation
**Scalability of Embeddings**
The scalability of embeddings depends on various factors:
‚Ä¢ Model Size: Larger models may require more memory and processing power, affecting
scalability.
‚Ä¢ Hardware Resources: The availability of sufficient hardware resources, such as GPUs, can
impact the speed and scalability of embedding computation.
‚Ä¢ Batch Processing: Implementing batch processing can enhance the scalability of embedding
computation, allowing for parallelization.
